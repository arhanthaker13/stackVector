Overview
StackVector1 is a simple C++ application designed to demonstrate basic stack operations using a vector.
The program allows users to push digrams (two-character strings) onto a stack, pop them off, and display the current contents of the stack.
It's an example of managing a custom stack in C++, with operations limited by a predefined maximum size.

Features
Push digrams onto the stack.
Pop digrams from the stack.
Display the current stack content.
Validation of input digrams to ensure they are composed of two alphabetic characters or punctuation marks.
Conversion of digrams to uppercase.
